The question comes up in every web project: WordPress or Next.js? The honest answer is that both have their place — but not in the same contexts. Here's a no-nonsense comparison for 2025.

## Market State in 2025

- **WordPress**: 43.4% of global websites, 64% of CMS used
- **Next.js**: Adopted by Nike, TikTok, Twitch, Notion, OpenAI
- **Performance**: Next.js sites have an average Core Web Vitals score of **87/100** vs **61/100** for WordPress (source: Web Almanac 2024)
- **Security**: WordPress represents **96% of hacked CMS** each year

These figures set the framework. Now let's look in detail.

## Technical Comparison

### Performance

| Criteria | WordPress | Next.js |
|---|---|---|
| Average LCP score | 3.2s | 0.9s |
| Average FID score | 180ms | 45ms |
| Average CLS score | 0.18 | 0.04 |
| Average page size | 2.8 MB | 780 KB |
| Build time | — | 30-90s |

These performances aren't anecdotal. Google has used Core Web Vitals as a **ranking factor** since 2021. An average WordPress site loses positions to competitors on Next.js.

**Concrete Business Impact:** Amazon calculated that **one extra second of latency costs $1.6 billion in sales per year**. At your scale, a 3× faster site can significantly improve your conversion rate.

### SEO

WordPress remains competent on SEO thanks to plugins like Yoast or RankMath. But Next.js has structural advantages:

- **SSG (Static Site Generation)**: pages are pre-generated, Google crawlers index them instantly
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: dynamic content is visible server-side, not just via JavaScript
- **Structured Metadata**: generated programmatically, always consistent
- **Images**: `next/image` component automatically optimizes WebP, lazy loading, responsive

### Security

WordPress is the main target of web attacks for a simple reason: its popularity. With **60,000+ plugins** in the ecosystem, each plugin is a potential attack vector.

In 2024, **30,000 WordPress sites** were compromised through a single vulnerability in a popular plugin.

Next.js is a frontend/full-stack application that doesn't have a comparable attack surface. No exposed database, no admin panel accessible at `/wp-admin`, no recognizable WordPress files.

### Total Cost of Ownership

| Item | WordPress (3 years) | Next.js (3 years) |
|---|---|---|
| Initial development | €3,000 - €8,000 | €5,000 - €15,000 |
| Hosting | €600 - €3,600 | €600 - €2,400 |
| Premium plugins | €300 - €1,200 | €0 |
| Maintenance / updates | €1,800 - €5,400 | €600 - €1,800 |
| Security incidents (average) | €800 - €4,000 | ~€0 |
| **Estimated Total** | **€6,500 - €22,200** | **€6,200 - €19,200** |

Over 3 years, Next.js costs less for medium-large projects — even if the initial investment is higher.

## When to Choose WordPress?

WordPress remains relevant in specific contexts:

✅ **Very limited budget** (< €2,000) with need for quick launch
✅ **Non-technical team** that must manage content autonomously
✅ **Simple editorial blog** with few custom features
✅ **Migration from existing WordPress site** with lots of content

Outside these cases, WordPress often generates more hidden costs than it saves.

## When to Choose Next.js?

Next.js is the natural choice for:

✅ **Business websites** that want to perform on Google
✅ **E-commerce** (via Shopify Storefront API or WooCommerce headless)
✅ **High-traffic sites** (> 10,000 visitors/month)
✅ **Web applications** with interactive features
✅ **Projects with AI integration or third-party APIs**
✅ **Competitive sectors** where technical SEO makes the difference

## The Special Case of Headless CMS

A third path exists and deserves mention: **WordPress headless**.

The idea: use WordPress only as a CMS back-office (where it excels) and serve the frontend via Next.js (where it performs). You benefit from the familiar editing interface + Next.js performance.

**Typical Stack:**
```
WordPress (headless) → REST API or GraphQL → Next.js frontend
```

This is an excellent option for teams that already have WordPress content and don't want to migrate everything, but want modern architecture performance.

## What We Recommend at NeuraWeb

After dozens of projects completed with both stacks, our recommendation is systematic:

| Project Type | Our Recommendation |
|---|---|
| SMB showcase site | Next.js (Starter Pack) |
| E-commerce | Next.js + Stripe |
| Blog + business site | Next.js + headless CMS (Sanity or Contentful) |
| Web application | Next.js + Node.js |
| Budget < €2k, urgent need | WordPress with lightweight theme |

Most projects benefit from Next.js. And the performance gap with WordPress will only widen as Google strengthens its Core Web Vitals criteria.

## Conclusion

WordPress is a formidable tool for what it was designed for: accessible content management. Next.js is the 2025 tool for building high-performing, secure, and scalable business websites.

Choose based on your context, not trends. But if you're building something that needs to perform long-term — Next.js is the obvious choice.
