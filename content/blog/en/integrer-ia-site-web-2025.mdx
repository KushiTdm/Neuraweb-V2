Artificial intelligence is no longer reserved for tech giants. In 2025, integrating AI features into your website has become accessible to all businesses. Here's a complete guide to get started.

## Different Types of AI Integration

### 1. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants

Modern AI chatbots (like those based on GPT-4 or Claude) can handle **70%+ of customer queries automatically**. They offer a fluid and natural experience, far from the basic bots of a few years ago.

**Use cases:**
- 24/7 customer support
- Dynamic FAQ
- User guidance during onboarding
- Automated appointment scheduling

### 2. Personalized Recommendations

AI can analyze your users' behavior to suggest relevant content or products.

**Example:** An e-commerce site can increase its conversion rate by **15-30%** thanks to personalized AI recommendations.

### 3. Real-Time Data Analysis

Detect trends, anomalies, and opportunities through automatic data analysis. AI can identify patterns invisible to the naked eye.

## How to Choose the Right Solution?

Here are the 3 questions to ask yourself:

1. **Define your objectives:** Customer support? Personalization? Automation?
2. **Evaluate your data:** Do you have enough data to train a model?
3. **Choose between build vs buy:** Existing APIs (OpenAI, Claude) vs custom solution.

## Recommended Tech Stack

| Component | Recommended Solution |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Frontend | Next.js + Vercel AI SDK |
| Backend | Node.js + LangChain |
| Vector Database | Pinecone or Supabase |
| LLM | GPT-4, Claude 3, or Mistral |

## Estimated Costs

| Solution | Monthly Cost | Typical ROI |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Simple chatbot (API) | €50-200 | 3-6 months |
| Custom AI agent | €500-2000 | 6-12 months |
| Complete RAG system | €1000-5000 | 12-18 months |

## Conclusion

AI integration is a profitable investment for most web businesses. Start small, measure results, and iterate.
