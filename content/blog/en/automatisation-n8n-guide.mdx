## Getting Started with n8n

### Installation

The simplest way to get started is using Docker:

### Create Your First Workflow

1. Add a **Trigger** (e.g., Webhook, Schedule, Manual)
2. Connect **Nodes** (services to integrate)
3. Configure **mappings** between nodes
4. Activate the workflow

## Concrete Example: Lead → CRM + Email + Slack

```
Webhook (lead reception)
    ↓
    ├── HubSpot (create contact)
    ├── Gmail (send welcome email)
    └── Slack (team notification)
```

This simple workflow saves you **2 hours per week** on manual lead processing.
